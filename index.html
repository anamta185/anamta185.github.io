            <p>Call of Duty, electronic game that brought new advances to the first-person shooter genre, winning
                numerous game of the year awards in 2003 and 2004 following its 2003 debut. Designed by the American
                company Infinity Ward and produced by Activision, Call of Duty used World War II as a setting, allowing
                players to see the war through the eyes of American, Soviet, and British soldiers. Call of Duty combined
                challenging single-player missions with a multiplayer engine that breathed new life into a genre spawned
                by such gaming greats as Doom and Quake. Call of Duty allowed players to advance through World War II in
                a series of campaigns or to battle it out against human opponents in its multiplayer mode. Solo play
                featured a cast of computer-controlled allies to better simulate actual war, during which a soldier
                would have been part of a large group rather than always fighting alone. The ability to pull up and aim
                firearms, to relive the last few seconds of a fallen comrade’s life, and to realistically be stunned by
                nearby explosions were notable features that helped distance the game from its competitors. The
                popularity of Call of Duty spawned multiple sequels and expansions, such as Call of Duty II, Call of
                Duty: Finest Hour, and Call of Duty III. The series explored new ground in 2007 when Call of Duty 4:
                Modern Warfare was released, giving players the chance to immerse themselves in a future conflict
                between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia. A hit with players and critics alike, Modern
                Warfare was the best-selling game of 2007 and helped the series maintain its place at the top of the war
                game genre. Its sequel, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, set entertainment industry records during its
                first five days of release in November 2009, grossing more than $550 million in worldwide sales. The
                game’s single-player mode featured a deeply engaging counterterrorism story line, and its robust
                multiplayer mode drew more than two million users to Xbox Live, marking a one-day record for the online
                gaming service. The franchise’s next release, Call of Duty: Black Ops, topped $360 million in sales on
                its first day of release in November 2010, easily becoming the largest entertainment opening of the
                year. The game featured a single-player story rooted in the events of the Cold War, and it offered an
                evenly balanced, heavily customizable multiplayer mode. The Modern Warfare series came to a close in
                November 2011 with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, a game that broke global records with $775 million in
                sales in its first five days of release.</p>

            <h4>ELECTRONIC GAME GENRE</h4>

            <p>Electronic shooter game, electronic game genre in which players control a character or unit that wields
                weapons to shoot enemies. While shooting games involving “light guns” and photoreceptors were
                experimented with as early as the 1930s, the birth of this genre of electronic games really began in
                1962 with Spacewar!, a software program developed to show off the power of the Digital Equipment
                Corporation PDP-1 minicomputer. The game included stellar objects that generated gravitation fields,
                which two players had to take into account as they maneuvered their spacecraft while shooting at each
                other and various asteroids. American computer programmers Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney simplified the
                game to one person shooting alien spaceships, and this version was published by Nutting Associates as
                Computer Space (1971), the first mass-produced coin-operated electronic game, or arcade game. Bushnell
                and Dabney later founded Atari Inc., from which they released the first commercially successful arcade
                game, Pong (1972), an electronic sports game based on table tennis (Ping-Pong).Although Computer Space
                had too steep a learning curve to prove a commercial success, the same cannot be said of Space Invaders
                (1978). An arcade console produced by Taito Corporation in Japan and licensed to Bally Technologies in
                the United States, Space Invaders was an enormous hit—so much so that Japan experienced a temporary
                shortage of 100-yen coins, which were used there to play the game. In 1980 Space Invaders became the
                first arcade game to be licensed for a home gaming console, the Atari 2600. Atari also released
                Asteroids (1979) and Missile Command (1980) as arcade games before they made their way to home console
                machines and personal computers (PCs). While early shooters generally had limited player mobility,
                typically involving nothing more than allowing the player to move a weapon horizontally or vertically
                along the edges of the screen, increased computer power enabled the development of games played from a
                first-person perspective. Although Wolfenstein 3-D (1992), produced by id Software for PCs, was not the
                original first-person shooter (FPS) game, it set the standard for the subgenre. id Software followed up
                with Doom (1993), the first FPS game with multiplayer support. Other popular FPS games released in the
                1990s include Duke Nukem 3D (1996), Quake (1996), Half-Life (1998), and Unreal Tournament (1999). This
                subgenre in particular has driven the development of the PC market, with players often rushing to
                upgrade or replace their PCs in order to handle ever more realistic game engines. In 2001 the Microsoft
                Corporation released its Xbox video console, which included the FPS game Halo as a launch title. Halo 2
                (2004) featured multiplayer support through Xbox Live, Microsoft’s online subscription gaming network.
                The Halo franchise accounted for much of the success of the Xbox, Xbox 360 console (2005), and Xbox
                Live. Although multiplayer combat remains as popular as ever, as evidenced by the success of such games
                as Valve’s Team Fortress 2 (2007) and Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops (2010), the market for pure
                single-player FPS games has declined in favour of games that blend elements from other genres.
                Successful variations on the FPS include the electronic adventure games Half-Life, Half-Life 2 (2004),
                and BioShock, which incorporate horror or survival elements, as well as more complex story lines. Valve
                was also responsible for Portal (2007) and Portal 2 (2011), a pair of first-person puzzle games that
                feature a darkly comic plot and wildly innovative game play.</p>

            <h1>Activision Blizzard, Inc.</h1>
            <h4>AMERICAN ELECTRONIC GAMES COMPANY</h4>
            <h4>WRITTEN BY:</h4>
            <h4>Michael Ray

            <p>Activision Blizzard, Inc., American developer and manufacturer of electronic games. The company was
                formed in 2008 by the merger of Activision, an entertainment software publisher that traced its roots to
                the original Atari game console, and Vivendi Games, the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment, a PC
                software publisher best known for the Diablo, Warcraft, and StarCraft franchises and for the massively
                multiplayer role-playing game World of Warcraft. At the conclusion of the merger, in which Activision
                was the senior partner, Vivendi purchased 52 percent of the stock in the newly formed Activision
                Blizzard. Both Activision and Blizzard maintained distinct corporate identities, with independent
                development and publishing streams. The company’s corporate headquarters are located in Santa Monica,
                Calif.</p>

            <h3>The History Of Activision</h3>

            <p>Activision was founded in 1979 by David Crane and Alan Miller—game designers who split with Atari over
                issues of creator’s rights—and entertainment executive Jim Levy. Their response was to create a company
                where designers would be an essential part of the brand identity, with the lead developer of a given
                title receiving credit on the game box. Soon after the company’s formation, they were joined by fellow
                Atari designers Larry Kaplan and Bob Whitehead. As the electronic gaming industry’s first third-party
                software developer, Activision immediately faced a legal challenge from Atari, which attempted to
                preserve its monopoly on games for the Atari VCS system. That suit was settled in 1982, but by that time
                Activision had already established itself as a thriving competitor in an expanding industry. Games such
                as Chopper Command and River Raid sported vibrant graphics and fluid gameplay, and Pitfall! represented
                one of the earliest examples of the platform game genre. The success of Activision inspired a wave of
                imitators, and soon the market was flooded with games of dubious quality. Between 1983 and 1984 the
                industry collapsed under the weight of its own overexpansion. Activision weathered the storm by shifting
                its focus to the burgeoning home computer market, but the ill-timed acquisition of text-based adventure
                game publisher Infocom almost doomed the company. A corporate reorganization led to the departure of
                much of the company’s creative talent, including the last of its founders, and in 1988 the Activision
                name was abandoned in favour of Mediagenic, as executives attempted to rebrand the company as a
                multipurpose software developer. Mediagenic struggled to stay afloat, but a change in ownership and
                management in 1990 signaled a dramatic turnaround. The company renamed itself Activision in 1992, and it
                spent the next few years building on the successes of its past, releasing titles such as Return to Zork
                (1993), a graphic adventure based on a classic Infocom game, and Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure (1994), an
                addictive platform game.Activision acquired a new generation of talented designers, and it won critical
                acclaim with PC offerings like Interstate ’76 (1997), a stylish, funk-infused, 3D vehicle combat game
                that anticipated such later titles as Grand Theft Auto from Rockstar Games. The company also forged
                lucrative partnerships with independent developers. Although development costs for new games soared,
                with a typical game costing millions of dollars to bring to market, Activision continued to post profits
                through the late 1990s and early 2000s. Activision and developer Infinity Ward launched the Call of Duty
                franchise in 2003, and the game immediately challenged Electronic Arts’ Medal of Honor series for
                supremacy of the first-person shooter market. Activision joined developers RedOctane and Harmonix Music
                Systems for the sequels to Guitar Hero (2005), a rhythm-based game that became a popular culture
                phemonenon. While future development of Guitar Hero titles was halted in 2011, other Activision
                properties remained strong, with Call of Duty consistently ranking as one of the most lucrative
                franchises in electronic gaming.</p>

            <h3>The History Of Blizzard</h3>

            <p>Blizzard Entertainment was founded in 1991 as Silicon & Synapse by Allen Adham, Michael Morhaime, and
                Frank Pearce, three UCLA graduates with an interest in electronic gaming. The company’s early projects
                were conversions of existing titles for a variety of home computer systems, but it soon released a
                number of original titles, including The Lost Vikings (1992), a clever platform game, and Rock ’N’ Roll
                Racing (1993), a vehicle combat game. The company changed its name to Blizzard Entertainment in 1994,
                shortly before it released Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, a real-time strategy game (RTS) that became one of
                the definitive works in that genre. Blizzard followed with Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness (1995), a
                graphically rich expansion on the original that offered a number of interface and multiplayer
                improvements.Multiplayer would figure heavily in Blizzard’s future success. The action role-playing game
                Diablo (1996) launched with Battle.net, a free service that allowed players to join multiplayer games
                and chat online. Battlenet’s player base expanded dramatically with the release of StarCraft (1998), an
                RTS game loosely based on the Warcraft model. Although StarCraft featured an engaging single-player
                campaign, its true strength was in its well-balanced multiplayer mode. The best-selling Diablo II (2000)
                refined the multiplayer elements that made the first Diablo a success. Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos (2002)
                incorporated limited role-playing elements into the standard RTS formula, and it allowed end users to
                create new game maps, import new sound effects, and radically alter the gameplay experience. The next
                entry in the Warcraft franchise deviated dramatically from the RTS roots of its predecessors, but it
                provided Blizzard with its biggest hit to date. World of Warcraft (WoW), a massively multiplayer online
                role-playing game, debuted in 2004, and it drew millions of players to the shared, persistent online
                world of Azeroth. The game built on the mythology of the earlier Warcraft titles, with orcs, dwarves,
                elves, and other fantasy tropes featuring prominently, but the social networking aspects of the game
                were perhaps its greatest strengths. In October 2010, almost six years after WoW’s release, the game
                boasted more than 12 million monthly subscribers. After numerous delays, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty
                reached stores in July 2010, accompanied by an upgraded version of Battle.net. The matchmaking platform
                was redesigned to more closely resemble online content distributors such as Valve Corporation’s Steam
                client or Apple’s iTunes service, as well as to provide a smoother transition between the single player
                and multiplayer experience.</p>

            <h5>Alternative Titles: computer game, video game</h5>

            <p>Electronic game, also called computer game or video game, any interactive game operated by computer
                circuitry. The machines, or “platforms,” on which electronic games are played include general-purpose
                shared and personal computers, arcade consoles, video consoles connected to home television sets,
                handheld game machines, mobile devices such as cellular phones, and server-based networks. The term
                video game can be used to represent the totality of these formats, or it can refer more specifically
                only to games played on devices with video displays: television and arcade consoles.</p>

            <h3>From Chess To Spacewar! To Pong</h3>

            <p>The idea of playing games on computers is almost as old as the computer itself. Initially, the payoffs
                expected from this activity were closely related to the study of computation. For example, the
                mathematician and engineer Claude Shannon proposed in 1950 that computers could be programmed to play
                chess, and he questioned whether this would mean that a computer could think. Shannon’s proposal
                stimulated decades of research on chess- and checkers-playing programs, generally by computer scientists
                working in the field of artificial intelligence. Many computer games grew out of university and
                industrial computer laboratories. Several historically important games functioned originally as
                technology demonstrations, after having been developed as “after hours” amusements by students and
                technical staff. For example, in 1958 William A. Higinbotham of the Brookhaven National Laboratory in
                New York used an analog computer, control boxes, and an oscilloscope to create Tennis for Two as part of
                a public display for visitors to the laboratory. Only a few years later Steve Russell, Alan Kotok, J.
                Martin Graetz, and others created Spacewar! (1962) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
                This game began as a demonstration program to show off the PDP-1 (Programmed Data Processor-1)
                minicomputer donated by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to MIT and the new Precision CRT Display
                Type 30 attached to it. This new technology appealed to the “hacker” culture of the Tech Model Railroad
                Club on campus, and its authors were members of this group. They wrote software and built control boxes
                that gave players the ability to move spaceships about on accurate star maps, maneuvering and firing
                space torpedoes at each other. Spacewar! was distinctly a product of MIT computing. The widespread
                adoption of the PDP line of minicomputers on other campuses and laboratories in the 1960s and ’70s made
                Spacewar! a ubiquitous part of computing culture. One such institution was the University of Utah, home
                of a strong program in computer graphics and an electrical engineering student named Nolan Bushnell.
                After graduating in 1968, Bushnell moved to Silicon Valley to work for the Ampex Corporation. Bushnell
                had worked at an amusement park during college and after playing Spacewar! he dreamed of filling
                entertainment arcades with such electronic games. Together with one of his coworkers at Ampex, Ted
                Dabney, Bushnell designed Computer Space (1971), a coin-operated version of Spacewar! set in a wildly
                futuristic arcade cabinet. Although the game—manufactured and marketed by Nutting Associates, a vendor
                of coin-operated arcades—was a commercial failure, it established a standard design and general
                technical configuration for arcade consoles. In 1972 Bushnell, Dabney, and Al Alcorn, another Ampex
                alumnus, founded the Atari Corporation. Bushnell asked Alcorn to design a simple game based on
                Ping-Pong, explaining by way of inspiration that Atari had received a contract to make it. While there
                was in fact no such contract, Alcorn was adept at television electronics and produced a simple and
                addictive game, which they named Pong. Unable to interest manufacturers of pinball games in this
                prototype, Bushnell and Alcorn installed it in a local bar, where it became an immediate success as a
                coin-operated game. After clearing a legal obstacle posed by the Magnavox Company’s hold on the patent
                for video games (discussed in the next section), Atari geared up to manufacture arcade consoles in
                volume. It thus created the “coin-op” game industry, achieving such success that it drew competitors
                into its new business space, the electronic game arcade, which became perhaps the main source for
                innovative electronic games well into the 1980s. (See Sidebar: Pac-Man.)</p>

            <h3>Early Home Video Consoles</h3>

            <p>After computers and arcades, the third inspiration for early electronic games was television. Ralph Baer,
                a television engineer and manager at the military electronics firm of Sanders Associates (later
                integrated into BAE Systems), began in the late 1960s to develop technology and design games that could
                be played on television sets. In 1966 Baer designed circuitry to display and control moving dots on a
                television screen, leading to a simple chase game that he called Fox and Hounds. With this success in
                hand, Baer secured permission and funding from Sanders management to assemble a small group, the TV Game
                Project. Within a year several promising game designs had been demonstrated, and Baer’s group
                experimented with ways of delivering games to households by means such as cable television. In 1968 they
                completed the Brown Box, a solid-state prototype for a video game console. Three years later Baer was
                granted a U.S. patent for a “television gaming apparatus.” Magnavox acquired the rights soon thereafter,
                leading in 1972 to production of the first home video console, the Magnavox Odyssey. The success of Pong
                as a coin-operated game led a number of companies, including Atari itself, to forge ahead with home
                versions and imitations of the game. Seeking to expand its coin-operated arcade business, Atari reached
                agreement with Sears, Roebuck and Company to manufacture and distribute the home version of Pong. Its
                success intensified the already brutal competition in this market. The Fairchild Channel F, released in
                1976, and the Atari 2600 VCS (Video Computer System), released in 1977, led a new generation of consoles
                that used programmable ROM cartridges for distribution and storage of game software. These systems were
                programmable in the sense that different game cartridges could be inserted into special slots—a
                technical step that encouraged the separation of game development from hardware design. Activision,
                founded in 1979 by former Atari game designers David Crane and Alan Miller and entertainment executive
                Jim Levy, was the first company exclusively focused on game software. By 1983, however, the flood of
                game titles for the leading home consoles had led to a consumer backlash against the unpredictable
                quality of these games and a sharp decline in the home console industry.</p>

            <h3>Interactive Fiction</h3>

            <p>Games developed for the first arcade and home consoles emphasized simplicity and action. This was partly
                out of necessity, because of the limitations of rudimentary display technologies, microprocessors, and
                other components and the limited memory available for programs. These traits also suited the goal of
                creating arcade games that would quickly swallow as many coins as possible. Still, while the designs of
                games such as Atari’s Breakout (1976) and Taito’s Space Invaders (1978) were elegantly streamlined,
                these arcade hits generally offered little in terms of strategic depth, narrative, or simulation value.
                By the end of the 1970s, however, several computer games seemed to offer different design possibilities
                from what could be achieved on home or arcade consoles. These games often relied on text, networking, or
                other capabilities available on computers in the academic laboratories where many of them were designed.
                One of the first was Hunt the Wumpus, which appeared in several versions for different systems. Kenneth
                Thompson, a researcher at Bell Laboratories, wrote one version in C for the UNIX operating system, which
                he had codeveloped; Gregory Yob wrote another in BASIC that was distributed widely through listings in
                early computer game magazines. Both versions were probably written in 1972. Hunt the Wumpus and games
                like it introduced the notion of defining a virtual space. Players explored this space by inputting
                simple text commands—such as room numbers or coordinates—from their keyboards. They enjoyed considerable
                freedom of navigation in exploring the caves, dungeons, and castles that were typical of such text-based
                games. Moreover, computer software could be easily shared, modified, and extended by programmers,
                resulting in a great variety of similar games. The defining computer game of the 1970s was Will
                Crowther’s Colossal Cave Adventure, probably completed in 1977. Text-based games of its ilk have since
                been known commonly as electronic adventure games. Crowther combined his experiences exploring
                Kentucky’s Mammoth Cave system and playing Dungeons & Dragons-style role-playing games with fantasy
                themes reminiscent of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings. Written in FORTRAN for the PDP-10 computer,
                Adventure became the prototype for an entirely new category of games, usually called “interactive
                fiction,” that boasted a new narrative structure. Such games shaped the player’s experience with
                descriptions of rooms, characters, and items and a story that evolved in response to the player’s
                choices. In Adventure this meant wandering through a dungeon to collect items and defeat monsters, but
                later titles featured more elaborate narratives. In 1977 Don Woods of the Stanford Artificial
                Intelligence Laboratory came across a copy of the source code for Crowther’s “ADVENT” program and
                carefully revised the game, adding new elements that increased its popularity. This version and its
                variants were widely distributed around the network of connected university and industrial computer
                laboratories and influenced other games, such as MIT’s Zork. By the late 1970s, home computers and video
                game consoles had also made commercial distribution of these games possible, and text-based or simple
                graphical versions of Adventure were provided for many of these systems. (See Sidebar: Zork.)</p>

            <h3>Personal Computer Games</h3>

            <p>By the late 1970s, electronic games could be designed not only for large university-based shared
                computers, video consoles, and arcade machines but also for the new breed of home computers equipped
                with their own general-purpose microprocessors and operating systems that could run software written in
                languages such as BASIC. Apple II (1977) from Apple Computer, Inc. (now Apple Inc.), and the IBM
                Personal Computer (1981) featured colour graphics, flexible storage capacity, and a variety of input
                devices. The Atari 800 (1979) and Commodore Business Machines’ Commodore 64 (1982) offered similar
                features, but they also retained cartridge slots for console-style games. Game designers took advantage
                of the greater flexibility of computers to explore new game genres, often inspired by complex
                paper-and-pencil role playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons, various board games, and Crowther’s
                Adventure. Interactive fiction was a particularly successful format on personal computers. Infocom,
                perhaps the most successful computer game company of the early 1980s, adapted this style of game to a
                variety of literary formats, such as science fiction and mysteries. Infocom began with the popular Zork
                series, inspired directly by Adventure and originally developed by a group of then-current and former
                students at MIT. Infocom games disdained graphics, relying on methods that allowed for more varied
                player input and story building and incorporating techniques such as language parsing and database
                programming to stimulate the player’s imagination. Other games—such as the King’s Quest series by Sierra
                On-Line (1983), military simulations and role-playing games published by Strategic Simulations
                Incorporated (founded in 1979), Richard Garriott’s Akalabeth/Ultima series (1979), and the sports and
                multimedia titles of Electronic Arts (founded in 1982)—extended the simulation and storytelling capacity
                of computer games. Networked games added a social dimension. Empire had been developed as part of the
                PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations) Project at the University of Illinois during
                the early 1970s, and the possibilities of social interaction and networked-based graphics were
                thoroughly explored in this project and the games that resulted from it. MUD (Multi User Dungeon),
                developed in 1979 by Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle at the University of Essex, England, combined
                interactive fiction, role playing, programming, and dial-up modem access to a shared computer. It
                inspired dozens of popular multiplayer games, known collectively as MUDs, that placed players in a
                virtual world that functioned on the basis of social interaction as much as structured game play.
                Hundreds of themed multiplayer MUDs were written during the 1980s and early ’90s.</p>

            <h3>The Return Of Video Consoles</h3>

            <p> On the heels of the collapse of the home console industry in the early 1980s, two Japanese manufacturers
                of coin-operated video games, the Nintendo Co., Ltd., and Sega Enterprises Ltd., introduced a new
                generation of video consoles, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES; 1985) and the Sega Genesis (1989),
                with graphics that equaled or exceeded the capabilities of personal computers. More important, Nintendo
                introduced battery-powered storage cartridges that enabled players to save games in progress so that
                they could later continue playing right where they had left off. Games such as Nintendo’s Super Mario
                Bros (1985) and The Legend of Zelda (1987; see Sidebar: The Legend of Zelda), as well as Squaresoft’s
                Final Fantasy series (1987; originally for Nintendo only), fully exploited the ability to save games in
                progress. They used it to provide deeper game experiences, flexible character development, and complex
                interactive environments. These qualities encouraged comparisons between video games and other narrative
                media such as cinema and led to the creation of powerful franchises and intellectual properties based on
                successful games set in expandable story worlds. While there were continuous improvements in home
                console technology, especially in graphics, storage, and controller technology through the 1990s, the
                next set of significant advances across a generation of video game consoles included the Sony
                Corporation’s Playstation 2 (2000), Nintendo’s GameCube (2001), and the Microsoft Corporation’s Xbox
                (2001). These consoles were defined in marketing and advertising primarily by their superior technology,
                especially 3D graphics and the exploitation of networking capabilities, which during the 1990s had been
                developed primarily for personal computer games.Alongside the goal of intense, immersive experiences
                made possible by technical advances such as graphics coprocessors available in personal computers and
                modern game consoles, another area of technical advance during the 1990s was mobile and handheld gaming.
                In 1989 Nintendo extended its business success with the introduction of Game Boy, a handheld game system
                with a small monochrome display. It was not the first portable game player—Nintendo had marketed the
                small Game and Watch player since 1980—but it offered a new puzzle game, Alexey Pajitnov’s Tetris
                (1989), an international best-seller that was ideally suited to the new device. The Game Boy line,
                continued by the Game Boy Advance in 2001, sold more than 100 million units from 1989 to 2007. That
                impressive sales figure was topped by the Game Boy’s successor, Nintendo’s DS family of handhelds, which
                debuted in 2004. By the early 21st century, the improving capabilities of cellular telephones offered
                another platform for mobile games. After the demonstrated success of purpose-built hardware such as the
                Game Boy, cell phones also gradually became viable platforms for electronic games, beginning with
                conversions of simple arcade games of an earlier era, such as Snake, released for Nokia phones in 1997.
                As the technical specifications of cell phones improved, games with colour or 3D graphics were
                developed. The potential for cell phone games was enhanced by the possibility of integration with
                real-time location-based tracking (such as GPS), messaging, and interaction with real-world events and
                places. The introduction of the Apple iPhone in 2007 and Apple’s App Store in 2008 stabilized marketing
                and distribution of mobile games as cell phone applications, and the business model was followed by
                developers who created games for other platforms, with varying degrees of success. Many small game
                developers moved to production of mobile games. Before long, a few of them had become major forces in
                the game industry, paced by Rovio Mobile, developer of the multiplatform blockbuster hit Angry Birds
                (2009).</p>

            <h3>Networked Games And Virtual Worlds</h3>

            <p>During the 1990s and 2000s, computer game designers exploited three-dimensional graphics, faster
                microprocessors, networking, handheld and wireless game devices, and the Internet to develop new genres
                for video consoles, personal computers, and networked environments. These included first-person
                “shooters”—action games in which the environment is seen from the player’s view—such as id Software’s
                Wolfenstein 3D (1991), Doom (1993), and Quake (1996) and Microsoft’s Halo (2001); sports games such as
                Electronic Arts’ Madden NFL series (1989), based on motion-capture systems and artificial intelligence;
                and massive multiplayer online games (MMOGs) such as Ultima Online (1997), EverQuest (1998), and World
                of Warcraft (2004), combining traits of MUDs with graphical role-playing games to allow thousands of
                subscribers to create “avatars” (that is, representative icons or animated computer characters) and to
                explore “persistent” virtual worlds. Communities of game players organized themselves around multiplayer
                teams (or “clans”), congregated on fan Web sites devoted to specific games, shared independent
                modifications (or “mods”) of published games, or circulated their own player-made movies and replays
                (“machinima”). These groups shared common interests in computer game titles, using the Internet,
                broadband connections, LAN (local area network) parties, and other applications of networking technology
                in ways that increasingly merged in-game and out-of-game social experiences. New forms of participation
                challenged game developers to produce games that accounted for gamer communities and encouraged
                player-created content. Examples of games that benefited from extending game play through the engagement
                of players included titles such as The Sims (2000) and LittleBigPlanet (2008).As electronic games moved
                into the mainstream of commerce and culture around the world, developers of electronic games explored
                social networks as a new platform, incorporated technologies that reworked the interactive and immersive
                aspects of game play, and applied game mechanics to many other fields of activity. The importance of
                virtual communities for online games emerged from the relatively closed worlds of MUDs and MMOGs with
                the massive global success of online games such as Runescape (2001) and World of Warcraft. Within a few
                years these numbers were matched and exceeded by games produced for social networking services such as
                Facebook, notably Zynga’s Mafia Wars (2008) and Farmville (2009) and Playfish’s Restaurant City (2009).
                The latest generation of home consoles introduced new technologies of motion control, most notably the
                Wii Remote for the Nintendo Wii system and the Kinect for Xbox 360. The cultural impact of electronic
                games throughout the world in the early 21st century was undeniable, paced by trends such as the growth
                and acceptance of game art; the “Serious Games” movement, which sought to integrate elements of
                electronic gaming into education and training; and the controversial advocacy of “gamification,” a term
                for the application of game mechanics to virtually any field of endeavour. Global sales of computer and
                video games, including hardware and accessories, exceeded $30 billion in 2002; less than a decade later,
                this figure had roughly doubled. In comparison, box office receipts for the American movie industry were
                about $9.5 billion in 2008. On the day of its release in November 2010, Activision Blizzard’s Call of
                Duty: Black Ops grossed $360 million in global sales, making it the biggest opening in entertainment
                history. Statistics such as these are often cited to demonstrate the continued growth and importance of
                computer games as an entertainment medium.</p>

            <p>Unreal Tournament, electronic first-person shooter (FPS) game, released by American game developer GT
                Interactive Software Corp. (now Atari, Inc.) in 1999. A sequel to the popular combat video game Unreal,
                Unreal Tournament represented a shift from single-player action to multiplayer online gaming. The game
                received critical acclaim for its superior graphics and advanced gameplay and for offering one of the
                first enjoyable team shooter games. Set in deep space, Unreal Tournament takes place in a distant future
                in which gladiator-style fights have been legalized. Players compete in tournaments using advanced
                weaponry and accomplish the goal of the particular game mode or mission while causing maximum carnage.
                Cooperative and team-play options are high points of Unreal Tournament, along with an advanced
                artificial intelligence engine. Available play modes include Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Domination,
                Last Man Standing, and Assault. Gore, long a trademark of the shooter genre, has plenty of
                representation in the game. Unreal Tournament’s popularity led to several well-received sequels: Unreal
                Tournament 2003 (2002), Unreal Tournament 2004 (2004), and Unreal Tournament 3 (2007). The popular and
                enduring franchise has inspired fans to create their own levels and features for the game using the
                original Unreal Tournament codes. These user-created modifications, known as mods, can be found at
                various Web sites and message boards on the Internet.</p>

            <h1>Super Mario Bros</h1>
            <h4>ELECTRONIC GAME</h4>
            <h4>WRITTEN BY:</h4>
            <h4>The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica</h4>

            <p>Super Mario Bros., console game created by the Japanese electronic game manufacturer Nintendo Company,
                Ltd., in 1985 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The game, which was based on the arcade game
                Mario Bros., helped launch one of gaming’s most popular franchises. It stars Mario and Luigi, two
                Italian plumbers who find themselves in the Mushroom Kingdom trying to rescue Princess Toadstool from
                the evil King Bowser. It is one of the best-selling game series, with more than 40 million copies sold.
                In the original Super Mario Bros., solo players pilot Mario, and an additional player can play as Luigi.
                The game is based on a series of side-scrolling levels, each filled with enemies ranging from
                mushroomlike Goombas to evil turtles known as Koopa Troopas. The levels take place in different
                settings, some in dungeons and some above ground, with fights against Bowser impersonators at the end of
                castle levels. Once the imposter is defeated, a Mushroom Kingdom resident informs Mario or Luigi that
                the princess is in another castle. The game is completed with the defeat of the true Bowser and the
                rescue of Princess Toadstool. Super Mario Bros. helped NES become a resounding success. The game
                inspired more than 10 direct game sequels; a television cartoon, The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!
                (1989); and a live action film, Super Mario Bros. (1993).</p>
